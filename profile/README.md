## Our Mission

Our mission is to create technology that solves problems and makes a positive impact on the world. We believe in the power of collaboration and open-source software to drive innovation and progress.

## Our Projects

We have a variety of projects that we are working on, ranging from developer tools to full-stack applications. Our main focus is AI, and all our projects are fine tuned on top of gpt3. Here are a few of our most popular projects:

- **CLUTTR**: An AI app that summerizes cluttered data.
- **TEST_X**: A mobile application that give challenges based on person's IQ.
- **CHROMA**: A mobile app for tracking your daily habits and improving your productivity.

We are always looking for new contributors to help us improve our projects and create new ones. If you're interested in contributing, please check out our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
